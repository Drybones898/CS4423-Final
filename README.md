# CS4423-Final

I've spent way too long working on AI with no clear results yet so I am quite behind on most features of the game. If I can't get the AI implemented, due to either not having enough time due to all my other projects or just not being able to figure it out, I'll just pivot to having the "battles" be puzzles where there are just static places that the player needs to move their pieces within a set amount of moves to win. Big loss on the gameplay loop side but big win on the my sanity side.
